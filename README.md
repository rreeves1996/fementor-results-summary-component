## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm far too removed from the fundamentals of HTML and CSS! Although I had a solid grasp on HTML and CSS before moving to things like React, SCSS and Tailwind CSS, I should've either been returning occasionally back to reaffirm core principles into my brain.

Although I had no problems using semantic HTML as that's a habit I've been trying to reinforce since before I even touched React, I was surprised by how much trouble I had trying to recreate a layout from a JPEG accurately. I should continue to try and do these recreations in the future to continue to improve my skills mocking up sites/layouts from static images.
